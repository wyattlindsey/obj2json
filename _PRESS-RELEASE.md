# OBJ to JSON geometry converter #

## Sub-Heading ##
  Zippy cloud-based .OBJ conversion utility for three.js users 

## Summary ##
  3D artists and developers have been using the Wavefront OBJ format for many years.  These days, Three.js brings 3D to your browser.  Use **OBJ to JSON geometry converter** to convert those old OBJ files into Three's latest proprietary JSON Geometry format.

## Problem ##
  The web needs a standardized 3D object format.  3D developers and artists have been using many ancient, difficult-to-read, esoteric and confusing file formats.  These make sense for pre-internet desktop applications, but what about the new JavaScript systems that use WebGL?
